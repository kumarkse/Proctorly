# you write all your code here

# just make sure that you have the above askQA function always so that it can be fetched

# now

# if u want question , u have it in the this file itself

# for user answer

from answerfile import getans


# this will return list of answer


# now u will have question , userans , and the actual answer will also be generated in this file itself.

# make sure to get the final stats in to an array  and a fucntion that will return it when called.
# so that i can render it on stats page.

# thanks.
